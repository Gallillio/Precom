# Website Styling Revamp Plan

## Overview
This plan transforms the current basic website into a modern, professional engineering consultancy site inspired by industry leaders like Buro Happold, Cundall, Royal HaskoningDHV, and BCG.

## Design Implementation Instructions
**Important:** When working on this styling revamp, always:
- Follow the comprehensive design guide in `design-guide.md` for specific implementation details
- Reference the detailed page designs, animation guidelines, and component specifications  
- Focus on transforming the entire theme and design to match professional engineering consultancy standards
- Implement advanced features like sticky navigation, mega menus, video backgrounds, parallax effects, animated cards, and filtering systems
- If additional assets are needed (videos, images, etc.), compile a list after code generation and present to user
- Ensure all implementations align with the established design system and color palette

## AI Asset Generation Protocol
**Critical:** When adding new assets during development:
- **Always add detailed AI generation prompts** to `assets-needed.md` for any visual assets
- Maintain brand consistency across all generated content using established guidelines:
  - Professional engineering consultancy aesthetic
  - Color palette: Deep blue (#003366), vibrant teal (#00B4A6)
  - Premium quality matching top-tier consulting firms
  - Brand values: Innovation, reliability, technical excellence, approachability
- Include specific technical specifications (dimensions, formats, quality requirements)
- Ensure visual narrative supports the overall design transformation goals
